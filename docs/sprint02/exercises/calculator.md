# Calculator Exercise

## Introduction

In this exercise, you will create a simple calculator using Node.js.

## Instructions

1. Create a new file named `calculator.js` and write a script that reads two numbers from the command line and prints the sum, difference, product, and quotient of the two numbers.

2. Use the `process.argv` array to read the command line arguments.

3. If the user does not provide two numbers, the script should print an error message and exit.

4. If the user provides invalid numbers, the script should print an error message and exit.

5. If the user provides a division by zero, the script should print an error message and exit.

6. Test your script with different inputs.
