# MCTW - Projeto web

## Welcome to MCTW - Projeto web!

This is a collaborative documentation project where we aim to provide comprehensive documentation for the MCTW - Projeto web.
All the contents of the classes will be available here, as well as the projects and exercises.

Each student is free to contribute to the documentation by submitting a pull request! Idea is to have a single place where we can find all the information about the classes and share our knowledge.
