# MCTW - Projeto web

Welcome to our open source documentation project for the MCTW - Projeto web! This project uses [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), a fast, simple, and downright gorgeous static site generator that's geared towards building project documentation. Documentation source files are written in Markdown, and configured with a single YAML configuration file. 
Feel free to contribute to our documentation by submitting a pull request!

## Getting Started

This section provides a quick overview of how to clone, install, and run the project locally on your machine.

### Prerequisites

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (3.5 or later)
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-organization/your-project.git
cd your-project
```

2. Install MkDocs and the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install mkdocs
pip install -r requirements.txt  # If you have additional dependencies

### Running Locally

To run the project locally and view the documentation in your browser:
